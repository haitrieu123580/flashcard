            `The more you practice recalling a piece of information or retrieving it from memory, the more likely you are to remember it later on. This psychological finding explains why it’s so much more effective to study with flashcards or by taking a practice test than it is to look over your notes until you feel like you know them. Getting feedback enhances the effect further.
         Keep practicing retrieval, even after you get a question right the first time!`,

        description: `When you answer written questions from memory (instead of copying over answers), this requires effortful retrieval or “recall”, which really helps you learn. Multiple choice questions are designed to get you through more questions in less time, with the added bonus of helping you learn the incorrect answer choices. 
        If you study with flashcards or multiple choice questions, make sure to try to recall the right answer before you look at the solution!`,
